as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down
by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing
down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of
half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information
as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen
other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least
interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.
'''

# Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well
# to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
# with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all
# the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't
# pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only
# caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with
# a face that a man might die for.

# My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others
# were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses
# were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried
# into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had
# followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
# them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I
# lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
# church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
# me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
